Example of configuration file for the resbd daemon is resbd.conf.
The machinelist is a file that lists either vms or containers
used by the rbserver client that starts/stops the vm or containers.
If the rbserver runs in cloud mode the instances are returned by
the cloud so no machine list is needed.

Install manually the resbd.conf file to /usr/local/etc or where
the installation etc is.
